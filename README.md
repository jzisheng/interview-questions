# Interview Questions

Here is a repo of coding questions that either I have not seen solutions for online, or my own implementation. These are all coded in Python. I'll be uploading videos. I'm following [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OFK5LeEyw) which organized leetcode problems by their fundamentals. I'm hoping to be able to explain foundations first, and then with that the problems will become clear to solve!


Categories of problems solved:

* depth first search
* breadth first search
* dynamic programming
  * [Integer Break ðŸŽ¦](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OFK5LeEyw)
* array (1d and 2d)
