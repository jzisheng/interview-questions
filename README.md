# Interview Questions

Here is a repo of coding questions that either I have not seen solutions for online, or my own implementation. These are all coded in Python. I'll be uploading videos. I'm following [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0OFK5LeEyw) which organized leetcode problems by their fundamentals. I'm hoping to be able to explain foundations first, and then with that the problems will become clear to solve!
