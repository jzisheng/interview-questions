Given an array of integers with elements representing lengths of ribbons. Your goal is to obtain k ribbons of equal length cutting the ribbons into as many pieces as you want. Find the maximum integer length L to obtain at least k ribbons of length L
```
Example 1:

Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 9], k = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: cut ribbon of length 9 into 3 pieces of length 3, length 4 into two pieces one of which is length 3 and the other length 1,
and one piece is already is of length 3. So you get 5 total pieces (satisfying k) and the greatest length L possible which would be 3.
